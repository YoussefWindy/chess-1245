## Rules
- Anytime we want to work on files, we first checkout to our respective branch
- Once we're done and want to commit, push to repo *while still in that branch*
- To do this, e.g. Andrew will do `git push origin Andrew` while in the Andrew branch
- After pushing to repo, we can merge the branch with the main branch
- To update the new files on our end, we pull and then merge main branch with our respective working branch
