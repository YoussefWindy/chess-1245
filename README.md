# Development Notes
**Anything That Needs To Be Noted/Remembered Goes Here**

## To Do
- Board object needs an iterator ???

## Working On
- ???

## Completed Tasks
- overloading operator<<
- Makefile now does stuff as some files have been added, yippie!

## Rules
- Anytime we want to work on files, we first checkout to our respective branch
- Once we're done and want to commit, push to repo *while still in that branch*
- To do this, e.g. Andrew will do `git push origin andrew` while in the Andrew branch
- After pushing to repo, we can merge the branch with the main branch
- To update the new files on our end, we pull and then merge main branch with our respective working branch
