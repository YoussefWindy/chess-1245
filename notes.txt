        ~~~~~~~~~~~ ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE NOTED/REMEMBERED GOES HERE ~~~~~~~~~~~

- Makefile doesn't rly do anything yet bcs we don't even know what files we're dealing with

- Anytime we want to work on files, we first checkout to our respective branch
- Once we're done and want to commit, push to repo *while still in that branch*
- To do this, e.g. Andrew will do `git push origin andrew` while in the Andrew branch
- After pushing to repo, we can merge the branch with the main branch
- To update the new files on our end, we pull and then merge main branch with our respective working branch

- If you read the above and are ok with the suggested system, type the number of letters in your first name in the discord chat
            (e.g. Andrew -> 6, Grey -> 4, etc.)
