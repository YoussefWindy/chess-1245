# 1. UML Class Model
## Introduction to UML Class Model
 - Explain the purpose and scope of the UML diagram.
 - Mention the classes and their relationships depicted.

## Class Diagram
 - Include classes like `ChessGame`, `Board`, `Piece`, `Player`, etc.
 - Show relationships (e.g., composition, inheritance) between classes.
 - Display public methods that depict interactions between classes.

## Justification
 - Explain design decisions behind class structure and relationships.
 - Describe how this initial model anticipates system functionalities.

# 2. Project Breakdown
## Project Overview
 - Briefly describe the chess project's objective and deliverables.

## Timeline and Milestones
 - Outline phases (e.g., planning, implementation, testing).
 - Specify start and estimated completion dates for each phase.
 - Assign responsibilities to team members for different parts of the project.

## Task Breakdown
 - Detail tasks for each phase (e.g., designing board representation, implementing movement logic).
 - Allocate estimated time for completion of each task.

# 3. Answers to Project Specification Questions
## Problem Solving Approach
 - Address each specified problem (e.g., handling legal moves, managing player turns).
 - Describe anticipated solutions using your UML model as a reference.

## Consistency Check
 - Ensure answers align with the UML model and project plan.
 - Anticipate any potential deviations and explain how they might arise.

# 4. Document Submission Details
## File Format
 - Specify the format and naming conventions for submission files (`uml.pdf` and `plan.pdf`).

## Page Limit and Formatting
- Ensure adherence to the specified page limit and formatting guidelines.

# 5. Conclusion
## Final Remarks
 - Summarize the importance of the plan of attack in guiding the project.
 - Highlight flexibility in adjusting the plan as needed during project execution.
